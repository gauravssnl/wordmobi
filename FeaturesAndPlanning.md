# Next feature to be implemented #

  1. Image resizing before upload to save bandwidth/upload time
  1. access point persistence
  1. upload to flickr
  1. multiple twitter accounts (one twitter account per blog)
  1. Summary in statistics dialog (number os posts, number of comments, number of new comments and so on)

# Future enhancements and ideas #

  1. Would it be possible to add option for upload post as private? I suggest add one option publish/savedraft/private. [#71](issue.md)
  1. Change background color, font color and maybe font when editing a new post.
  1. "test connection" option in access point selection/proxy/twitter setup
  1. to upload also movies and other kind of files to his / her wordpress blog. There are many live-streaming apps allowing you to post / stream video directly from your mobile (CellSpin, Qik, LiveCliq, Flixwagon), but none of them is really helping when it comes to edit text or to arrange the post page.
  1. Also adding .pdf or .doc to your webbased wordpress blog
  1. Image selection with thumbnails support
  1. Avoid app to be terminates when the red key is pressed
  1. Icons for indicating the post status: draft, local, edited or just remote
  1. blogger support
  1. Default button label customizations with uikludges/uitricks
  1. html support when editing comments
  1. better icon for "about" menu entry
  1. calendar view, showing days with posts
  1. preview option in other places, like post title window, not only inside post contents
  1. allow categories inclusion inside post edit window
  1. sub categories support
  1. search in posts
  1. batch operations (multiple selection for deleting and approving, for instance)
  1. create a css for better post preview
  1. add title in html (post preview)
  1. better exception handler, providing more elucidative messages
  1. retry option when uploading images
  1. custom entries for html formatting.I think it is possible to add this option and make the blogger life easier with all their tags already coded in some "custom" menu.
  1. better camera support when taking photos
  1. Offline comments
  1. Offline category/TAGs creation
  1. Edit permalinks
  1. Threaded comment
